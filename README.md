goal: make money

- what is the highest leverage task an agent can do? 
- Answer: make money in public markets
    - how would you do this?
    - stock price reflects market sentiment. people determine how they feel about a stock based on information they have
    - thus information is the key driver for a stock price.
    - llms have all the information in the internet and the ability to find new information.
    - the question becomes whether it can find the right information.
        - whether the swarm can find the right niche information, piece it together, and find patterns
        - the information you need is likely in PDFs (from company edgar annuals), legislation, news etc OR
        - in what key people in the center are saying (both explicitly and implicitly), doing (deals, bills etc)
        - look at what doesn't make sense -> that is usually where the key is. Pattern recognition.
    - input to the model: a public company and it's current stock price. output: the forecasted stock price + the swarm's evidence/reasoning. 

find the center and watch them
the center is the economy. individuals + market forces != economy, center + debt relationships = economy. 
the center adjusts the obligations it enforces
When the center shifts terms the entire system reorients instantly
If you want to understand (or profit from) markets, you study the center - who it is, what obligations it enforces, how its rituals are evolvingâ€”not the surface noise.
    - Will Manidis: the "markets" are ritualized social networks of a very small number of live players/market participants.
