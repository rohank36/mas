    - llms have all the information in the internet and the ability to find new information.
    - the question becomes whether it can find the right information.
        - whether the swarm can find the right niche information, piece it together, and find patterns

find the center and watch them
the center is the economy. individuals + market forces != economy, center + debt relationships = economy. 
the center adjusts the obligations it enforces
When the center shifts terms the entire system reorients instantly
If you want to understand (or profit from) markets, you study the center - who it is, what obligations it enforces, how its rituals are evolvingâ€”not the surface noise.
    - Will Manidis: the "markets" are ritualized social networks of a very small number of live players/market participants.
